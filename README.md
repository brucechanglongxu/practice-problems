# Hi Mo, I’ve managed to addressed everything for the red-black-problem except for the second bullet in the above image, which I am struggling to write a test-case for — I could certainly restructure the code so that an erroneous input is considered by the main expected-value  function, but at the moment it is addressed in the try-except logic. My understanding is that when we do not take in an integer input, then we never really run expected-value in main and therefore, there is no “output value” that we can check for. What I am trying to do is to change the control logic within our red-black-cards.py to be controlled by a global boolean that determines whether the input parameters are valid integers or not — although if this is the case, then the try-except would be made redundant, so probably not a good solution. Any tips on how to write a unit test for this?
