// Rust is different from dynamic languages like Ruby, Python and Javascript
// in the sense that compiling and running the program are two separate steps
// it is an ahead-of-time compiled language
// as long as we provide an executable to another user or machine 
// they will be able to run it

// Compilation is rustc [file]
// running the file will be ./file

fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!")
}
